        <h4 class="text-center">Thank you for visiting our site</h4>
        <p>We have public-domain music, arrangements, and original music composed, arranged, and edited by Lisa Baird-Conklin and 
        Thomas Conklin. Much of the music here is free to download in PDF form while other pieces 
        may be purchased. We can also provide customizations and
        write commissioned pieces specifically suited to your needs for an additional fee.</p>
        <br/>
        <h4 class="text-center">What's New?</h4>
        <p>This website is currently in progress. I am currently creating the functionality for us to upload our compositions so
          they will be viewable and searchable.  The only thing you can do right now is to create an account.  Please check back later.
          I hope to have our music up soon.</p>
